A simple portfolio website I'm developing for myself.

The main principal behind this site is to be simple and to the point for:  
a) Getting to know me as a person and the culture I will bring to the table  
b) Having a short portfolio display of the top side projects I develop for demonstrating my abilities as a developer  
c) Having a means to see and download an up-to-date resume that I maintain through Google Docs
