            Hey there! I hope you're doing well! <br/>
            My name's Justin and I'm a problem-solver by nature, which is why I 
            love the challenges that arise when programming.<br/><br/>

            When I think of programming, I like to think of it as an art form 
            that utilizes a blend of  analytics, creativity, and logic to create 
            elegant solutions that help run our world.<br/><br/>

            I have been learning programming since I was taught the basics with 
            C/C++ back in 2006. Since then I have gone from the basics of 
            C/C++ to creating pages from scratch using HTML/CSS and either getting 
            expose to, or becoming familiar with a variety of developer tools.<br/><br/>

            Aside from programming I also like hiking, camping, volleyball, 
            reading, video games, art (digital or drawing), and a new found 
            interest in archery.
